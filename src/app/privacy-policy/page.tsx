      </p>
      <p>
        Our Website offers you the ability to register and login using your third-party social media
        account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will
        receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile
        information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often
        include your name, email address, friends list, profile picture as well as other information you
        choose to make public on such social media platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy

        control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party

      </p>
      <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out
        in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as
        tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping
        your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with
        us.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will
        either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
        information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

      <p>
        We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect
        the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to
        secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage
        technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,
        cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and
        improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to
        protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Website is
        at your own risk. You should only access the Website within a secure environment.

      <p>Right to be informed &ndash; Request to know</p>

      <p>Verification process</p>
      <p>
        Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same
        person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to
        ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously
        provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide
        certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we
        already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email)
        that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the
        circumstances dictate.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority
        to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from
        you for the purposes of verification. If, however, we cannot verify your identity from the
        information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for
        the purposes of verifying your identity, and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will
        delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.

          you may request to opt-out from future selling of your personal information to third parties.
